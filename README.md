### What I learned

This project took way longer than I expected and the learning process wasn't easy. For now I believe that I am getting better with CSS, HTML, and React. However, they are still hard to navigate and code all the same time. I loved building the website and navigation for Little Lemon since this is a new project that I learned. Overall, this course was very long, but it was so many things learned and my skills have improved so much!

Codes that caught my eye:

```css
* {
  --primary-1: #495E57;
  --primary-2: #f4ce14;
  --black: #000000;
  --white: #ffffff;
  --secondary-1: #ee9972;
  --secondary-2: #fbdabb;
  --highlight-1: #edefee;
  --highlight-2: #333333;
}
```
